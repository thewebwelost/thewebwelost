### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on project to help people manage their job applications, keep track of resume variations and manage search-related contacts, companies etc.

My interest lies in creating full-stack apps using TypeScript, React and newer frontend tools including Next, Vite, Astro on for frontend and Express for backend systems.

Feel free to check both Outerview and Outerview_be repos.
